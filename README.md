##Problems ⁉️
📓
1.Problem with webpack-dev-server
Originaly  should be "webpack-dev-server" but with webpack v5 and webpack-cli v4 it doesn't work. It lead to this error:

Error ❗ 
Cannot find module 'webpack-cli/bin/config-yargs'
Solution 🙋
For me it was changing "webpack-dev-server" to "webpack serve'. You can check it below
